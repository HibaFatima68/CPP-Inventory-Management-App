Inventory Management System with OOP

Main Classes:
=============
1. Inventory
2. Customer
3. Stock
4. Supplier
5. Payment

... later on keep adding the classes. 

Structure (Assuming Console App)
================================

1. Entry Point (Main.cpp)
=========================
> This will display the menu and we can simply use Switch Case to call the relevant method of a class. 
> We also have to include classes as headers in main.cpp so that it can access all the methods described in API of the classes. 


2. Classes
==========
(a) Header File
===============
> These will initiate the class and make the API (public methods and attributes)
> Also it will define any value / variable / attributes / private / protected members etc. 

(b) Cpp File
=============
> These is where we will program every class. Including Constructors, Methods etc. 
> These files will include relevant class header file.
